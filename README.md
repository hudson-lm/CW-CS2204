# Visionary Innovation Hub (Coursework CS2204 Project)
A semester 1A project developed for CS2204, implemented with HTML, CSS, and Javascript to create a fully-functional and responsive website. Designed for cross-device compatibility and a user-friendly interface.

## HTML
- Implemented the use of headings, sections, forms, and lists.
- Applied semantic structure, meta tag usage for responsiveness and SEO, and external CSS and JS linking.

## CSS
- Demonstrated CSS proficiency through responsive styling, dynamic animations, cohesive color palettes, and border designs to enhance user experience.
- Leveraged pseudo-classes (:hover, :active, :first-child) and pseudo-elements (::before, ::after) to enhance user interaction and visual feedback.
- Organized embedded CSS by grouping related styles in <style> sections, creating a structured and reusable codebase.

## JavaScript
- Implemented data management using new Map() to store zone and company entries, leveraging dictionary-style hashing via Map.get() for efficient key-value retrieval.
- Employed OOP principles with DOM selectors (querySelector, querySelectorAll, getElementById) to streamline element targeting and reduce code redundancy.
- Applied event handlers (addEventListener, onclick) with callback functions to create interactive UI components while maintaining clean separation of concerns.
